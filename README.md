# Email Notifications
This is a simple tool that uses Google API to send notification emails.
I mainly append it at the end of my programs to send me an email when it is finished so that I do not have to check on it every time.

## Usage
This tool uses [Yagmail](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail) where you can learn to set your Google API up from their [readme](https://github.com/kootenpv/yagmail/blob/master/README.md).

You will then need to set you email_notification.py with the receiver email address and the credentials file location.

After that, it is as simple as the two liner test_notif.py.
